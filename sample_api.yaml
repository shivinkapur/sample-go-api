  description: "This is a sample Pet Store Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.\
    \  You can find out more about\nSwagger at [http://swagger.io](http://swagger.io).\
    \ In the third iteration of the pet store, we've switched to the design first\
    \ approach!\nYou can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes\
    \ to the definition itself or to the code.\nThat way, with time, we can improve\
    \ the API in general, and expose some of the new features in OAS3.\n\nSome useful\
    \ links:\n- [The Pet Store repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore)\n\
